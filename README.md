# __Hello!__

I am __Jacob Brown__, I am a full time student, game making hobist, and ex-part time web developer!
This here is my own website thanks to GitHub Pages and my own long hours of work here and there.

## About this website

I wanted a place to connect the different areas of my life, it is home to what I am working on right now,
what I have worked on before, and everything you need to know to get in touch with me and see what I am doing
between these different adventures. Now this website itself is just held together by HTML, CSS, basic JS, and
too many long nights by yours truly. I thought about using React, Vue, Node, or anything else but the basics,
but I decided I'd build this simply. Everytime I looked into doing more and how much I could do I kept going
down and down, and I decided to finally ask "why do I need to do any of these things for a simple site?" And 
I couldn't tell you! So I am using the basics, and thats it, these pages won't be my magnumopis thats for sure,
but it will tell my story, and that is what I need it to do.

At the moment this is the best path for me, motivationally, finantially, and efficently. I have used php, larevel,
and others to work on websites before but building them around GH Pages and all the bug testing that could cause 
would slow down the production of this website too much and most likely leave me burned more than anything, so
I'll still make templates and if I can use them without react or nodes help, I'll do that, but I'll mainly use them
to copy paste what I need over to a new page and just fill it in myself. If I ever move to self hosting or a different
hosting service I will likely overhaul the site and add in vue components and so on.

Most of my desisions and thoughts are on a google doc that I try to keep updating with ideas of what to add, what
rules to follow and so on. I do actually share that in the works page for this site, plus you can find it below in links
